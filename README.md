# Game_Log
This is one of my first projects built using the Angular 2 framework. I originally started this project following a bunch of tutorials while learning to build web applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I wanted to make this project my own so I put a lot of my own designs into it and the whole idea of a "Game Logger" is an original idea of mine (although not original in the global scope of things).

My vision for this application is to create my own personal database of games I have played and what rating I gave them. This is a work in progress.
